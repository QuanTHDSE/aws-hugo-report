### Session 3: Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock (10:45 AM - 12:00 PM)

**Exploring Large Language Models:**
- Comparing models: Claude, Llama, Titan
- Selecting the right model for each use case
- Practical applications of GenAI in business

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
- Problem with standard LLMs: knowledge cutoff date, no access to private data
- RAG architecture: Retrieve + Generate → Accurate answers with sources
- Real-world application: Vietnamese customer support with 95% satisfaction

**Bedrock Agents:**
- Multi-step process: Plan → Select tools → Execute → Iterate
- Integration with Lambda, DynamoDB, external APIs
- Example: Automated return order processing from start to finish
