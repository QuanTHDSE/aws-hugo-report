During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd.** from **September 8, 2025** to **November 28, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.

I participated in **building a cloud-based video streaming platform using AWS services,** through which I improved my skills in **cloud architecture design, serverless computing, CI/CD implementation, frontend development, and technical documentation.**

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.
